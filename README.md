### Hi there 👋

### My name is Michael and I'm PHP and .NET developer
<sub>*mostly back-end, but sometimes I try to do something with Javascript or other front-end technologies.*</sub>

- - -

I don't have that goal yet, but I hope I will maintain my profile and repositories more carefully soon.
For now feel free to watch and comment on my repositories - maybe it will add some inspiration to me.

- 💼 I’m currently working at [Satellite-Soft LLC](http://www.satellite-soft.ru)
- 🌱 I don't study anywhere currently, but hope to enter university next year.
- 💬 Ask me about... PHP and .NET (unexpectedly, right? (not the best part))
- ✨ Dreaming about travels around the world
- 🗣️ If you somehow interested in communicating with me it would be a wonderful opportunity for me to develop my english-speaking skills

*Thanks for reading!*
